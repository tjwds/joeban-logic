# joeban-logic

Simple implementation of the gameplay logic of Go (also known as weiqi or baduk), designed for later extension and use in other application formats.  Portmanteau of "Joe" and "goban," get it?

This is a work in progress â€” in that I wrote it in a handful of hours and haven't tested it other than the basics!
